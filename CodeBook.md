1 subject (integer)


2 activity (character)

Variables 3 to 68 are numeric
 

They are measures taken a samsung smart phone using its accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 

The acceleration signal is separated into body and gravity acceleration signals tBodyAccXYZ and tGravityAccXYZ 

The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerkXYZ and tBodyGyroJerkXYZ.

The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

In each case the “t” represents the measure on the time domain.

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag.  

'f' is to used to indicate frequency domain signals
 
XYZ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

In all cases the mean and standard deviation was calculated for each activity for each subject, where ‘mean’ indicates the mean and ‘std’ indicates the standard deviation. 

In all cases, the measures are normalised within the range of [-1,1].  Thus the unit of measure is this normalised measure.
